If the player encounters an obstacle 
(wall/rock), movement is blocked.

If the player collides with a guard, 
they lose.

Movement continues in the chosen 
direction until stopped by an obstacle.

Guards react differently: 
some move randomly, while others chase 
the player. 

Bombs can destroy rocks but not walls. 
The explosion affects adjacent tiles. 

The game ends when the player loses all 
lives or reaches the exit door.
